Throughout the semester our group focused on the theme of war throughout literature. One aspect of this the many, and sometimes unconventional, forms that war can take. Another aspect is the war ingrained in our culture. Lastly is the cultural wars in society and the intersectionality of them and those fighting them. This portfolio documents our journey through this semester.
