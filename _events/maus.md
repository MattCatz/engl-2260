Art Spiegelman's Maus-which is a "graphic novel," a book-length sequential narrative using pictures, a cartoon- book-functions in a quite different way: where the typical cartoon desensitizes us to violence, Spiegelman sensitizes us, despite the fact that he traps his characters within visual stereotypes that threaten to destroy their sensibilities.[source][1]
