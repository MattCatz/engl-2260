In The Education of  Henry  Adams,  there  is  a  well-known  chapter  entitled,  "The  Dynamo  and  the  Virgin."  On  the  surface,  the  chapter,  a  gem  of  an  essay  unto  itself,  is  about  the  Great  Exposition  of  1900  held  in  Paris.  In  a  slightly  deeper  sense,  "The  Dynamo  and  the  Virgin"  is  a  reflection  on  the  sources  and  significances  of  power.  On  the  one  hand,  the  dynamo  gets  its  power  from the natural  world.  As  Adams  says:  "The  dynamo  itself  was  but  an  ingenious  channel  for  conveying  somewhere  the heat  latent  in  a  few  tons  of  poor  coal hidden  in  a  dirty enginehouse  carefully  kept  out  of  sight."[source][1]
