Reading has affected my life for as long as I can remember. When I was a young child, my parents read stories to me. Then as I grew older, I found my interests in literature evolved from stories about heroes, to books and articles about math and science, and finally to articles and other forms of information about sports and technology, primarily Auburn football and software development.

The earliest form of reading I can recall is when my mother or father would read stories to me before I went to sleep at night. As a young child, I was interested in the typical story about a hero saving the world. When I was finally able to start reading by myself, I enjoyed reading the same type of story that my parents used to read to me. My interest in reading seriously declined when I went to school and the teachers assigned reading for schoolwork. I did not enjoy reading the teachers’ choice of literature for the class. This caused me to find interests outside of literature. 

I found a love for technology and sports. I would spend all afternoon outside with my brothers and friends playing sports and games. When it got dark outside, I would come inside and watch sports and movies on TV with my dad. As I grew older, I started to find interests in expanding my knowledge of science and mathematics. This is when my interests in reading started to increase again. I started to read about current events in science and topics in math and science about which I did not have much knowledge. This newfound enjoyment of reading quickly spread to sports news and media. I started keeping up with sports as if it was a religion. I would watch ESPN’s SportsCenter, read magazines, and read sports news on the internet. I could not get enough of it. When the offseason came, I found myself extremely bored. My father’s occupation is a software engineer. In an effort to help my boredom, he introduced me to the idea of software development. 

My enjoyment of software development and computer programming began at this time. I changed my focus from reading about science, math, and sports to reading about and practicing software development. This lead to where I am today. I’m a senior in software engineering with the same interests regarding reading. Today, I continue to practice and read more about the complex ideas behind software engineering. I also still enjoy reading news and articles about sports with the main focus being Auburn football. However, I still have a difficult time getting interested in literature required for school. I have no problem forcing myself to get through the required readings, but I don’t have the same excitement I do for reading about technology and sports. 

Literature and reading have seriously affected my life. I do not have the interests in most literature and reading required for school, but I do spend the majority of my day reading about sports and technology. During my life, I have found that there is a topic or genre of reading that anyone can enjoy. Everyone has different interests and mine do not always align with what I am assigned at school. Without the experiences I have had with reading throughout my life I would not be the same person I am today.
