## Our World Through Literature
Literature: writings in prose or verse; especially : writings having excellence of form or
expression and expressing ideas of permanent or universal interest [Merriam-Webster]

Literature influences who I am. While unconventional I consider math and science texts to be an important part of literature. This concept was my gateway to appreciating literature.
Some of my earliest memories reading start around the release of the third Harry Potter
book. Strangely my parents and I started the series in the middle; they read the whole book to me. Being read to became a recurring theme of my introduction to literature. My parents read the whole Harry Potter series to me; I was around fifteen when they finished. I enjoyed stories but was never enthralled with literature. This was not because of a lack of comprehension, but literature to me seemed to be only about escaping our world.

However, further into school I discovered that literature can and does expand oneâ€™s view of the world. Once I got further into school, teachers began to encourage learning outside of the classroom; this is when I began to appreciate literature. Literature for me became not a way to escape, but a way to expand my understanding of our world. Any topic of interest can be explored through literature and literature allows us to converse with those who came before us. I found this most interesting. Like those authors, I wanted to expand my knowledge into greater understanding. Literature then became an outlet to explore and question my world more.

This revelation about literature still affects my life today. Though it may not seem
overt, it drives my curiosity. It encourages communication of complex ideas. It lets my
interpersonal skills grow and helps me communicate my ideas more thoroughly. Throughout school we were taught how to apply literary analyses to traditional literature. The same analysis applies to math and science literature. A strong literary structure lets the documents store complex ideas.  I frequently use literary analyses while researching for engineering projects. A project of mine might be based on someone else's previous experiment. It is up to me to approach their documentation and to extract themes, concepts, ideas and merit from math and science literature to analyze, communicate and apply them to my work.

My perspective on literature translates directly to my professional career. During school I was given the opportunity to participate in a work study software engineering internship. This internship required real responsibility and I had full-time co-workers. I was expected to learn, understand and apply complex ideas relevant to the domain. Co-workers would explain the general concept but left me with more questions than I started with. I would be forced to find the IEEE published standards to read and analyze. Without the ability to extract and apply these standards I would have been at a standstill with no way to move forward in my work. My prior understanding of literature allowed me to use these documents as a tool to get ahead.
