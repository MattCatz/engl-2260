<center><h1>My Involvement with Literature</h1></center>

Reading literature is something that is mind-expanding, where you always find something new in a good book that can change your perspective. I used to not be too big into reading—I always thought of it like a chore, and sometimes it still feels that way. Nevertheless, I can’t say I haven’t enjoyed every minute of it and welcomed the impact on my life. The first time I had this change of heart was in my high school literature class when I read books such as In Cold Blood and Of Mice and Men. These books, one non-fiction, and the other fiction, both have great power in the words held inside. Something about the stories expressed in them had me hooked. The second change occurred when my dad purchased some books he found important for any well-rounded person to have read. In a sense, these books were the cause of great change in the world and in myself. I remember The Prince, The Art of War, and many others. These sparked my interest in many different ways. Not all the books my father purchased were political; some were skeptical and inquisitive of the human condition such as “The Collected Poems of W.B Yeats”This leads into the question of the effects on my life by indulging such literature. Every book I have the pleasure to read is like a portal: it takes me to the place and time held within, where I have the chance to experience things quite impossible in the physical world. In these books, the lessons and the emotions can almost be like you were there yourself. I have often found myself a changed person after reading a book. These changes may be life-altering, like those I have experienced from reading Truman Capotes In Cold Blood. This novel was about the analysis of human thought and the changing cultures of the early 60’s through the mind of a murderer. This novel forced me to take the perspectives of murderers and their victims, which, at the time, was something I have never done before. The experience from this novel opened my eyes to the perspectives of each and brought their own rationale into my own purview. Another book that greatly touched my life was Of Mice and Men. This novel had an impact on me because I related heavily with the two main characters—since I am the eldest brother of 3 younger siblings, I could understand George Milton, who had to take care of a mentally disabled adopted brother and the responsibilities that entail. This novel, through the characters’ actions, brought into perspective that the world may never understand you or your problems, but you may only have a limited time with those you love and to make the best of it. As for a poem, my changed perspective of war came from W.B Yates’ “An Irish Airman Foresees His Death”. This short poem had to lead me to the conclusion that even though we fight wars for people we do not love we also kill people we don’t hate. No matter the outcome of the war, life for some people will not have change for better or for worse. All of these stories have had a measurable effect on my life, which I can say has been very positive.
