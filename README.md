Auburn American Literature After 1865 Group Eportfolio 

<https://mattcatz.github.io/engl-2260/>

Your eportfolio is a website that your group creates to showcase the thought and work you've done in this class this semester.  The group eportfolio will collectively examine the connection between literature and just one of the following themes:

- Civil Rights
- Medicine
- Science
- Journalism
- Disease
- Education
- Physical Environment
- Special Needs/Disabilities
- Technology
- Art
- Business/Industry
- Law
- Mental Illness
- War
- Demographics
- Transportation
- Literary Trends
- Economy
- Economic/Social Class
- Religion
- Philosophy

Each of you will contribute a reading memoir, an overview essay, and an analysis paper to this group eportfolio.  The eportfolio will include a brief abstract on the main page that explains what the site is about and that contains links to the other pages in your group eportfolio.  So, then, you will have:

    - a welcome page
    - a contributor page for each member (this will be your reading memoir adapted to this context)
    - an overview page for each member to highlight individual work on the group project
    - a set of links to the pdf versions of each memberâ€™s analysis essay

For these pages you will paste in the revised text of your earlier assignments artfully combined with artifacts.  In addition to the texts themselves, the whole eportfolio should contain a minimum of fifteen other artifacts, which may include additional active links beyond those already assigned, photos, charts, graphs, audio or video files, PowerPoint shows, and/or pdfs.  I am allowing you to choose the platform on which you want to build your eportfolio.  You might choose Canvas, Google, Wix, Weebly, Tumblr, or WordPress, for instance.  If you are practiced at web design and HTML, then you may create your own site using the space that the University provides you as students.  And you may go beyond the minimum requirements as long as they do not detract from or diminish the professional quality of the site.  Finally I require you to email me the link to your eportfolio so that I may assemble them on a special page in our class Canvas site.
